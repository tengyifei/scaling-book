If you don’t, message us! We’d love to know how we could make this clearer.</p> <h3 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care?</h3> <p>Three or four years ago, I don’t think most ML researchers would have needed to understand any of this. But today even “small” models run so close to hardware limits that doing novel research requires you to think about efficiency at scale.<d-footnote>Historically, ML research has followed something of a tick-tock cycle between systems innovations and software improvements. Alex Krizhevsky had to write unholy CUDA code to make CNNs fast but within a couple years, libraries like Theano and TensorFlow meant you didn't have to. Maybe that will happen here too and everything in this book will be abstracted away in a few years. But scaling laws have pushed our models perpetually to the very frontier of our hardware, and it seems likely that, in the near future, doing cutting edge research will be inextricably tied to an understanding of how to efficiently scale models to large hardware topologies.</d-footnote> <strong>A 20% win on benchmarks is irrelevant if it comes at a 20% cost to roofline efficiency.</strong> Promising model architectures routinely fail either because they <em>can’t</em> run efficiently at scale or because no one puts in the work to make them do so.</p> <p><strong>The goal of “model scaling” is to be able to increase the number of chips used for training or inference while achieving a proportional, linear increase in throughput.</strong> This is known as “<em>strong scaling</em>”. Although adding additional chips (“parallelism”) usually decreases the computation time, it also comes at the cost of added communication between chips. When communication takes longer than computation we become “communication bound” and cannot scale strongly.<d-footnote>As your computation time decreases, you also typically face bottlenecks at the level of a single chip. Your shiny new TPU or GPU may be rated to perform 500 trillion operations-per-second, but if you aren't careful it can just as easily do a tenth of that if it's bogged down moving parameters around in memory. The interplay of per-chip computation, memory bandwidth, and total memory is critical to the scaling story.</d-footnote> If we understand our hardware well enough to anticipate where these bottlenecks will arise, we can design or reconfigure our models to avoid them.<d-footnote>Hardware designers face the inverse problem: building hardware that provides just enough compute, bandwidth, and memory for our algorithms while minimizing cost. You can imagine how stressful this "co-design" problem is: you have to bet on what algorithms will look like when the first chips actually become available, often 2 to 3 years down the road. The story of the TPU is a resounding success in this game. Matrix multiplication is a unique algorithm in the sense that it uses far more FLOPs per byte of memory than almost any other (N FLOPs per byte), and early TPUs and their systolic array architecture achieved far better perf / $ than GPUs did at the time they were built. TPUs were designed for ML workloads, and GPUs with their TensorCores are rapidly changing to fill this niche as well. But you can imagine how costly it would have been if neural networks had not taken off, or had changed in some fundamental way that TPUs (which are inherently less flexible than GPUs) could not handle.</d-footnote></p> <p><em>Our goal in this book is to explain how TPU (and GPU) hardware works and how the Transformer architecture has evolved to perform well on current hardware. We hope this will be useful both for researchers designing new architectures and for engineers working to make the current generation of LLMs run fast.</em></p> <h2 id="high-level-outline">High-Level Outline</h2> <p>The overall structure of this book is as follows:</p> <p><a href="roofline">Section 1</a> explains roofline analysis and what factors can limit our ability to scale (communication, computation, and memory). <a href="tpus">Section 2</a> and <a href="sharding">Section 3</a> talk in detail about how TPUs and modern GPUs work, both as individual chips and — of critical importance — as an interconnected system with inter-chip links of limited bandwidth and latency. We’ll answer questions like:</p> <ul> <li>How long should a matrix multiply of a certain size take? At what point is it bound by compute or by memory or communication bandwidth?</li> <li>How are TPUs wired together to form training clusters? How much bandwidth does each part of the system have?</li> <li>How long does it take to gather, scatter, or re-distribute arrays across multiple TPUs?</li> <li>How do we efficiently multiply matrices that are distributed differently across devices?</li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-480.webp 480w,/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-800.webp 800w,/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product.gif" class="img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure:</b> a diagram from <a href="tpus">Section 2</a> showing how a TPU performs an elementwise product.

We strongly believe it’s worth understanding every piece of the Transformer architecture: the exact sizes of every matrix, where normalization occurs, how many parameters and FLOPs<d-footnote>FLoating point OPs, basically the total number of adds and multiplies required. While many sources take FLOPs to mean "operations per second", we use FLOPs/s to indicate that explicitly.</d-footnote> are in each part. <a href="transformers">Section 4</a> goes through this “Transformer math” carefully, showing how to count the parameters and FLOPs for both training and inference. This tells us how much memory our model will use, how much time we’ll spend on compute or comms, and when attention will become important relative to the feed-forward blocks.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-480.webp 480w,/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-800.webp 800w,/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/scaling-book/assets/img/transformer-diagram.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure:</b> a standard Transformer layer with each matrix multiplication (matmul) shown as a dot inside a circle.

This is a simple question with a surprisingly complicated answer. At a high level, there are 4 primary parallelism techniques used to split models over multiple chips (<strong>data</strong>, <strong>tensor</strong>, <strong>pipeline</strong> and <strong>expert</strong>), and a number of other techniques to reduce the memory requirements (<strong>rematerialisation</strong>, <strong>optimizer/model sharding (aka ZeRO)</strong>, <strong>host offload</strong>, <strong>gradient accumulation</strong>). We discuss many of these here.</p> <p>We hope by the end of these sections you should be able to choose among them yourself for new architectures or settings. <a href="applied-training">Section 6</a> and <a href="applied-inference">Section 8</a> are practical tutorials that apply these concepts to LLaMA-3, a popular open-source model.</p> <p>Finally, <a href="profiling">Section 9</a> and <a href="jax-stuff">Section 10</a> look at how to implement some of these ideas in JAX and how to profile and debug your code when things go wrong.</p> <p>Throughout we try to give you problems to work for yourself. Please feel no pressure to read all the sections or read them in order. And please leave feedback. For the time being, this is a draft and will continue to be revised.

The first three chapters are preliminaries and can be skipped if familiar, although they introduce notation used later. The final three parts might be the most practically useful, since they explain how to work with real models.</em></p> <p><strong>Part 1: Preliminaries</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="roofline"><strong>Chapter 1: A Brief Intro to Roofline Analysis</strong></a>. Algorithms are bounded by three things: compute, communication, and memory. We can use these to approximate how fast our algorithms will run.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="tpus"><strong>Chapter 2: How to Think About TPUs</strong></a>. How do TPUs work? How does that affect what models we can train and serve?</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="sharding"><strong>Chapter 3: Sharded Matrices and How to Multiply Them</strong></a>. Here we explain model sharding and multi-TPU parallelism by way of our favorite operation: (sharded) matrix multiplications.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Part 2: Transformers</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="transformers"><strong>Chapter 4: All the Transformer Math You Need to Know</strong></a>. How many FLOPs does a Transformer use in its forward and backwards pass? Can you calculate the number of parameters? The size of its KV caches? We work through this math here.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="training"><strong>Chapter 5: How to Parallelize a Transformer for Training</strong></a>. FSDP. Megatron sharding. Pipeline parallelism. Given some number of chips, how do I train a model of a given size with a given batch size as efficiently as possible?</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="applied-training"><strong>Chapter 6: Training LLaMA 3 on TPUs</strong></a>. How would we train LLaMA 3 on TPUs? How long would it take? How much would it cost?</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="inference"><strong>Chapter 7: All About Transformer Inference</strong></a>. Once we’ve trained a model, we have to serve it. Inference adds a new consideration — latency — and changes up the memory landscape. We’ll talk about how disaggregated serving works and how to think about KV caches.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="applied-inference"><strong>Chapter 8: Serving LLaMA 3 on TPUs</strong></a>. How much would it cost to serve LLaMA 3 on TPU v5e? What are the latency/throughput tradeoffs?</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Part 3: Practical Tutorials</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="profiling"><strong>Chapter 9: How to Profile TPU Code</strong></a>. Real LLMs are never as simple as the theory above. Here we explain the JAX + XLA stack and how to use the JAX/TensorBoard profiler to debug and fix real issues.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="jax-stuff"><strong>Chapter 10: Programming TPUs in JAX</strong></a>. JAX provides a bunch of magical APIs for parallelizing computation, but you need to know how to use them. Fun examples and worked problems.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="conclusion"><strong>Chapter 11: Conclusions and Further Reading</strong></a>.
