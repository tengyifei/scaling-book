The TensorCore is the gray left-hand box, containing the matrix-multiply unit (MXU), vector unit (VPU), and vector memory (VMEM).</figcaption> </figure> <p>You can think of the TensorCore as basically just being a really good matrix multiplication machine, but it has a few other functions worth noting. The TensorCore has three key units:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>MXU</strong> (Matrix Multiply Unit) is the core of the TensorCore. For most TPU generations, it performs one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bfloat16[8,128] @ bf16[128,128] -&gt; f32[8,128]</code> matrix multiply<d-footnote>TPU v6e (Trillium) has a 256x256 MXU, while all previous generations use 128x128</d-footnote> every 8 cycles using a systolic array (see <a href="#appendix-b-how-does-a-systolic-array-work">Appendix B</a> for details). <ul> <li>This is about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5e13</code> bf16 FLOPs/s per MXU at 1.5GHz on TPU v5e. Most TensorCores have 2 or 4 MXUs, so e.g. the total bf16 FLOPs/s for TPU v5e is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2e14</code>.</li> <li>TPUs also support lower precision matmuls with higher throughput (e.g. each TPU v5e chip can do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4e14</code> int8 OPs/s).</li> </ul> </li> <li>The <strong>VPU</strong> (Vector Processing Unit) performs general mathematical operations like ReLU activations or pointwise addition or multiplication between vectors. Reductions (sums) are also performed here. <a href="#appendix-c-tpu-internals">Appendix C</a> provides more details.</li> <li> <strong>VMEM</strong> (Vector Memory) is an on-chip scratchpad located in the TensorCore, close to the compute units. It is much smaller than HBM (for example, 128 MiB on TPU v5e) but has a much higher bandwidth to the MXU. VMEM operates somewhat like an L1/L2 cache on CPUs but is much larger and programmer-controlled. Data in HBM needs to be copied into VMEM before the TensorCore can do any computation with it.</li> </ul> <p><strong>TPUs are very, very fast at matrix multiplication</strong>. It’s mainly what they do and they do it well. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v5p#system_architecture" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TPU v5p</a>, one of the most powerful TPUs to date, can do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.5e14</code> bf16 FLOPs / second / core or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5e14</code> bf16 FLOPs / sec / chip. A single pod of 8960 chips can do 4 exaflops / second. That’s <em>a lot</em>. That’s one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. And Google has a lot of them.<d-footnote>TPUs, and their systolic arrays in particular, are such powerful hardware accelerators because matrix multiplication is one of the few algorithms that uses $O(n^3)$ compute for $O(n^2)$ bytes. That makes it very easy for an ordinary ALU to be bottlenecked by compute and not by memory bandwidth.</d-footnote></p> <p>The diagram above also includes a few other components like SMEM and the scalar unit, which are used for control flow handling and are discussed briefly in <a href="#appendix-c-tpu-internals">Appendix C</a>, but aren’t crucial to understand. On the other hand, HBM is important and fairly simple:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>HBM</strong> (High Bandwidth Memory) is a big chunk of fast memory that stores tensors for use by the TensorCore. HBM usually has capacity on the order of tens of gigabytes (for example, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v5e#system_architecture" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TPU v5e has 16GiB of HBM</a>).</p> <ul> <li> <p>When needed for a computation, tensors are streamed out of HBM through VMEM (see below) into the MXU and the result is written from VMEM back to HBM.</p> </li> <li> <p>The bandwidth between HBM and the TensorCore (through VMEM) is known as “HBM bandwidth” (usually around 1-2TB/sec) and limits how fast computation can be done in memory-bound workloads.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Generally, all TPU operations are pipelined and overlapped.</strong> To perform a matmul $X \cdot A \to Y$, a TPU would first need to copy chunks of matrices $A$ and $X$ from HBM into VMEM, then load them into the MXU which multiplies chunks of 8x128 (for $X$) and 128x128 (for $A$), then copy the result chunk by chunk back to HBM. To do this efficiently, the matmul is pipelined so the copies to/from VMEM are overlapped with the MXU work. This allows the MXU to continue working instead of waiting on memory transfers, keeping matmuls compute-bound, not memory-bound.</p> <p>Here’s an example of how you might perform an elementwise product from HBM:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-480.webp 480w,/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-800.webp 800w,/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/scaling-book/assets/img/pointwise-product.gif" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure:</b> an animation showing a pointwise product performed on TPU, with bytes loaded from HBM. Note how bytes are streamed out of memory in chunks and partial results are pipelined back without waiting for the full array to be materialized.</figcaption> </figure> <p>A matmul would look nearly identical except it would load into the MXU instead of the VPU/Vector unit, and the loads and stores would occur in a different order, since the same weight chunk is used for multiple chunks of activations. You can see chunks of data streaming into VMEM, then into the VREGs (vector registers), then into the Vector Unit, then back into VMEM and HBM. As we’re about to see, if the load from HBM to VMEM is slower than the FLOPs in the Vector Unit (or MXU), we become “bandwidth bound” since we’re starving the VPU or MXU of work.</p> <p class="takeaway"><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> TPUs are very simple. They load weights from HBM into VMEM, then from VMEM into a systolic array which can perform around 200 trillion multiply-adds per second. The HBM $\leftrightarrow$ VMEM and VMEM $\leftrightarrow$ systolic array bandwidths set fundamental limits on what computations TPUs can do efficiently.</p> <p><strong>VMEM and arithmetic intensity:</strong> VMEM is much smaller than HBM but it has a much higher bandwidth to the MXU. As we saw in <a href="../roofline">Section 1</a>, this means if an algorithm can fit all its inputs/outputs in VMEM, it’s much less likely to hit communication bottlenecks. This is particularly helpful when a computation has poor arithmetic intensity: VMEM bandwidth is around 22x higher than HBM bandwidth which means an MXU operation reading from/writing to VMEM requires an arithmetic intensity of only 10-20 to achieve peak FLOPs utilization. That means if we can fit our weights into VMEM instead of HBM, our matrix multiplications can be FLOPs bound at much smaller batch sizes. And it means algorithms that fundamentally have a lower arithmetic intensity can still be efficient. VMEM is just so small this is often a challenge.<d-footnote>We sometimes talk about VMEM prefetching, which refers to loading weights ahead of time in VMEM so we can mask the cost of loading for our matmuls. For instance, in a normal Transformer we can sometimes load our big feed-forward weights into VMEM during attention, which can hide the cost of the weight load if we're memory bandwidth bound.

Let’s work a few problems to explain why this is useful. You’ll see more examples in Part 3.</p> <p><strong>Question 1 [bounding LLM latency]:</strong> Say you want to sample from a 200B parameter model in bf16 that’s split across 32 TPU v4p. How long would it take to load all the parameters from HBM into the systolic array? <em>Hint: use the numbers above.</em></p> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> We’re loading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sizeof(bf16) * 200e9 = 400e9</code> bytes on 32 chips, meaning 12.5e9 bytes / chip, each with an HBM bandwidth of 1.23e12. So the load takes around 10ms.</p> <p>That’s pretty cool, because <em>that’s a reasonable lower bound on the latency of sampling</em> from the model. Each sampling step needs to load all parameters from HBM, so it cannot take less than 10 ms. In practice, at small batch sizes, this is close to being achievable.</p> </details> <p><strong>Question 2 [TPU details]:</strong> Consider a full TPU v5e pod. How many total CPU hosts are there? How many TPU TensorCores? What is the total FLOPs/s for the whole pod? What is the total HBM? Do the same exercise for TPU v5p pod.</p> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For TPU v5e, each pod is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16x16</code> and each host is a 4x2 slice, so we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16*16 / 8 = 32</code> hosts. For TPU v5e, each TPU has only one core, so we have 256 TensorCores. The total FLOPs/s is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16*16*2e14 = 5.1e16</code> in bfloat16. Each chip has 16GB of HBM, so that’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">256 * 16 = 4TB</code> of memory.</p> <p>For a full TPU v5p pod, we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16x20x28</code> chips and each host is 2x2x1, so we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16*20*28 / 2*2 = 2,240</code> hosts. For TPU v5p, each TPU has two TensorCores, so we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8960 * 2 = 17,920</code> cores. The total FLOPs/s is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8960 * 4.5e14 = 4e18</code> in bfloat16.

This is running on a single host, and we’re using a single TPU v6e chip attached to it. You can assume $B \ll D$, and $F = 4D$ (we’ll see in future chapters why these are reasonable assumptions). What is the smallest batch size $B$ we need to remain FLOPs bound over PCIe? Assume PCIe bandwidth of 1.5e10 bytes / second.</p> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> We have to perform $2BDF$ floating point operations, and each chip can perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9.2e14</code> floating point operations per second. This then requires $2BDF / 9.2e14$ seconds to perform. We have to load $2DF + 2BD$ bytes from DRAM, and write $2BF$ bytes back to it. We are bottlenecked by PCIe transfer speeds, so we need $2 \cdot (BD + DF + BF) / 1.5e10$ seconds to transfer data to and from the TPU. Since we want computation to take longer than weight loading, assuming we can overlap all weight loading with computation, we want $2BDF / 9.2e14 &gt; 2 \cdot (BD + DF + BF) / 1.5e10$. We can simplify this using our assumptions that $B \ll D$, and $F = 4D$, to get</p> \[\frac{8BD^2}{9.2e14} &gt; \frac{8D^2}{1.5e10}\] <p>or</p> \[B &gt; \frac{9.2e14}{1.5e10} \simeq 61,000\] </details> <p><strong>Question 4 [general matmul latency]:</strong> Let’s say we want to multiply a weight matrix int8[16384, 4096] by an activation matrix of size int8[B, 4096] where B is some unknown batch size. Let’s say we’re on 1 TPUv5e to start.</p> <ol> <li>How long will this multiplication take as a function of B? <em>Hint: it may help to calculate how long it will take to load the arrays from HBM and how long the multiplication will actually take.

How long would it take as a function of B?</li> </ol> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> (1) The number of floating point operations we need to perform is $2 \cdot 4096 \cdot 16384 \cdot B = 1.3e8 \cdot B$. So $T_{\text{math}} = (1.3e8 \cdot B) / 3.94e14$ seconds. We need to load $16384 \cdot 4096 + 4096 \cdot B$ bytes from HBM to VMEM, and write back $16384 \cdot B$ bytes from VMEM to HBM. This means $T_{\text{comms}} = (6.7e7 + 2e4\cdot B) / 8.1e11$ seconds. Assuming as much overlap of communication and computation as possible, the whole multiplication will take approximately</p> \[\max\{T_{\text{math}}, T_{\text{comms}}\} = \max\left\{\frac{6.7e7 + 2e4\cdot B}{8.1e11}, \frac{1.3e8 \cdot B}{3.94e14}\right\}\] <p>We’ll be FLOPs-bound when $\frac{6.7e7 + 2e4\cdot B}{8.1e11} &lt; \frac{1.3e8 \cdot B}{3.94e14}$, or equivalently, $B &gt; 271$. This is slightly larger than the 240 number we derive below because we factor in the full impact of \(D\) and \(F\).</p> <p>(2) If instead we are loading from VMEM, let’s consider VMEM bandwidth to the MXU as 22 times the HBM $\leftrightarrow$ VMEM bandwidth. This turns our data loading denominator from 8.1e11 to 1.78e13, and we get $B &gt; 11$. _Note that in practice, we cannot dedicate all of our VMEM bandwidth to loading $W$, so in practice it will be closer to 20.</p> </details> <p><strong>Question 5 [ICI bandwidth]:</strong> Let’s say we have a TPU v5e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4x4</code> slice. Let’s say we want to send an array of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bfloat16[8, 128, 8192]</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TPU{0,0}</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TPU{3, 3}</code>. Let’s say the per-hop latency for TPU v5e is $1\mu s$.</p> <ol> <li>How soon will the first byte arrive at its destination?</li> <li>How long will the total transfer take?</li> </ol> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In a TPUv5e we have 2D connectivity. Because we have only a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4x4</code> slice (with no axes of size 16), we have no wraparound connections. Thus there are two ports from which our target chip can receive data, and likewise two ports from which our source chip can send data. The amount of data we have to transfer is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2 * 8 * 128 * 8192 = 1.7e7</code> bytes. We can transfer from both ports simultaneously (i.e. send half the array right and half down), so we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2 * 4.5e10 = 9e10</code> bytes transferred per second, which means it’ll take about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.7e7 / 9e10 = 188us</code> to transfer the whole array through (assuming we’re bandwidth bound). In a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4x4</code> slice, we have six hops between chips $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 3)$, since there are no wraparound links for axes with fewer than 16 chips. Since the latency of each hop is about $1\mu s$, the first byte will arrive in about<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6us</code> and the total transfer will take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">188 + 6 = 194us</code>.</p> </details> <p><strong>Question 6 [pulling it all together, hard]:</strong> Imagine you have a big matrix <strong>A</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int8[128 * 1024, 128 * 1024]</code> sharded evenly across a TPU v5e 4x4 slice but offloaded to host DRAM on each chip. Let’s say you want to copy the entire array to TPU{0, 0} and multiply it by a vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bf16[8, 128 * 1024]</code>. How long will this take? <em>Hint: use the numbers above.</em></p> <details><summary>Click here for the answer.</summary> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Let’s start by outlining the operations we have to perform. Our array is about 16GB. From the table above, a TPU v5e host has a 4x2 topology, so a 4x4 has 2 hosts, Thus, since our array is evenly sharded, each host effectively contains a chunk of 1/2 of the array, or 8GB. We need to copy these chunks all to TPU{0,0}, which gives us two options:</p> <ol> <li>We can copy over DCN and then load the entire unsharded array over PCIe into HBM.</li> <li>We can load our sharded arrays onto their corresponding TPUs, then perform a gather over ICI, then perform the matmul on TPU{0,0}.</li> </ol> <p>It should be clear that option (2) is better. DCN is slow compared to ICI and we’d much prefer to load a big array over many PCIe links rather than just a few (the 8 on host 0). Here’s a diagram of part of the system. As described above, note that TPUs are connected to their neighbors by ICI (even across hosts), all TPUs are connected to their host CPU (via PCIe), and hosts are connected by DCN.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/scaling-book/assets/img/challenge-problem-480.webp 480w,/scaling-book/assets/img/challenge-problem-800.webp 800w,/scaling-book/assets/img/challenge-problem-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/scaling-book/assets/img/challenge-problem.png" class="img-fluid img-small" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Now let’s work through how long each piece will take:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>PCIe load</strong>: we’re loading chunks of 16GB / 2 = 8GB over 8 PCIe links, each of which has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.5e10</code> bytes/second bandwidth. Thus this will take about 66ms.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>ICI copy:</strong> each TPU now has 16GB / 16 = 1GB of our array. Our ICI bandwidth is 10e10 bytes/second per link <em>bidirectional</em>, and you’ll notice from the above diagram that only 2 of the 4 ICI links on the TPU v5e are in use in this topology. Since TPU{0,0} needs to receive a total of 15GB along 2 axes at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.5e10</code> bytes/s/link, we can lower bound the time by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15e9 / (4.5e10 * 2) = 167ms</code>. In practice this probably isn’t achievable because the load is very uneven, but it’s probably within a factor of 2. As you’ll see in Section 2, performing a full AllGather would also take roughly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16e9 / (4.5e10 * 2)</code>, so this is close to optimal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>HBM $\rightarrow$ MXU load:</strong> to perform our final matmul, we need to load these 16e9 bytes plus the bf16[8, 128 * 1024] array (another 2MB, so negligible) over HBM bandwidth into the MXU, which will take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">16e9 / 8.1e11 = 19ms</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>FLOPs:</strong> we’re performing a total of \(2 \cdot 8 \cdot 128 \cdot 1024 \cdot 128 \cdot 1024 = 2.7e11\) FLOPs, and since we can perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.97e14</code> bf16 FLOPs/s, we get 1.3ms.</p> </li> </ol> <p>An upper bound for the total time is the sum of all of these times, but since the TPU can typically overlap these operations, we can think of this as a pipelining problem that’s bottlenecked by the slowest piece. Assuming that’s true, then the answer is about 150-200ms.</p> </details> <h3 class="next-section">That’s it for Part 2!

Each streaming multiprocessor (SM) has a small L1 cache used to speed data access and for register spilling. A section of the memory used for the L1 cache can also be declared as shared memory allowing access from any thread in the thread-block, and is used for user-defined caches, parallel reductions and synchronization, etc. Lastly, there is an additional L2 cache that is shared by all SMs.</li> <li>Primary difference is that NVIDIA GPUs are typically in ‘cliques’ of 8-256 GPUs via switches (NVLink $\rightarrow$ NVSwitch), which allow for point-to-point communication between any GPU within that ‘clique’, but that means communication between more than 256 is significantly slower - this means training on more than 256 typically requires pipeline parallelism to scale, which is more complex (by contrast, PaLM was trained on two cliques of 3072 TPU chips each)</li> <li>For common neural net operations such as AllReduce, all-to-all connections do not hold an advantage (as the same communication patterns must occur regardless), but it does allow for storing MoE models across more GPUs and transmitting the experts around more efficiently</li> <li>Each GPU requires a switch that costs similar to the GPU itself, making on chip interconnect like ICI cheaper</li> <li><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-gpu-background/index.html#gpu-arch" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA deep learning performance</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/data-center/nvlink/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NVSwitch</a></li> <li>Very different Tensor Parallelism / Pipeline Parallelism transition point!</li> </ul> <h3 id="appendix-b-how-does-a-systolic-array-work">Appendix B: How does a systolic array work?</h3> <p>At the core of the TPU MXU is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">128x128</code> systolic array (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">256x256</code> on TPU v6e).

With that said, it’s important that our matrices have shapes larger than the side dimension of the MXU, which is generally 128x128. Some TPUs (since TPU v3) have multiple MXUs, either 2 for TPU v3 and 4 for TPU v4/5, so we need to ensure tiling dimensions are larger than 128 * number of MXUs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJltBQ4MOHA" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here’s</a> a good animation for this.</p> <p>Trillium (TPU v6e) has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">256x256</code> systolic array, which means it can perform 4x more FLOPs / cycle. This also means the dimensions of your tensors needs to be twice as large to utilize the MXU fully.</p> <h3 id="appendix-c-tpu-internals">Appendix C: TPU internals</h3> <h3 id="scalar-core">Scalar Core</h3> <p>The TPU scalar core processes all of the instructions and executes all of the transfers from HBM into vector memory (VMEM). The scalar core is also responsible for fetching instructions for the VPU, MXU and XLU components of the chip. One side-effect of this is that each core of the TPU is only capable of creating one DMA request per cycle.</p> <p>To put this in context, a single 4 scalar core controls a VPU consisting of 2048 ALUs, 4 MXUs, 2 XLUs, and multiple DMA engines. The highly skewed nature of control per unit compute is a source of hardware efficiency, but also limits the ability to do data dependent vectorization in any interesting way.</p> <h3 id="vpu">VPU</h3> <p>The TPU vector core consists of a two dimensional vector machine (the <strong>VPU</strong>) that performs vector operations like vadd (vector addition) or vmax (elementwise max) and a set of vector registers called <strong>VREGs</strong> that hold data for the VPU and MXU. The VPU is effectively a 2D vector arithmetic unit of shape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(8, 128)</code> where the 128 dimension is referred to as a lane and the dimension of 8 is referred to as a sublane. Each (lane, sublane) pair on v4 contains 2 standard floating-point and integer ALUs. From a software point-of-view, this creates the appearance of a 8x128 vector unit with a total of 2048 floating point adders in v4. TPU v4 has 32 VREGs of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(8, 128)</code> which the VPU loads from and writes to.</p> <p>The VPU executes most arithmetic instructions in one cycle in each of its ALUs (like vadd or vector add) with a latency of 2 cycles, so e.g. in v5 you can add 4 pairs of f32 values together from VREGs in each cycle. A typical VPU instruction might look like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{v2 = vadd.8x128.f32 v0, v1}</code> where v0 and v1 are input VREGs and v2 is an output VREG.</p> <p>All lanes and sublanes execute the same program every cycle in a pure SIMD manner, but each ALU can perform a different operation. So we can e.g. process 1 vadd and 1 vsub in a single cycle, each of which operates on two full VREGs and writes the output to a third.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> <div class="base-grid appendix-entry"> <h3 style="grid-column: 0;">Miscellaneous</h3> <p class="author-footnote" style="grid-column: text;"><sup>*</sup>Work done at Google DeepMind, now at MatX.</p> </div> <div class="base-grid appendix-entry"> <h3 style="grid-column: 0;">Citation</h3> <p class="author-footnote">For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as:</p> <div class="author-footnote"> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="c">Austin et al., "How to Scale Your Model", Google DeepMind, online, 2025.</span>
